Assumption: ChromeDriver is installed locally. ChromeDriver can be downloaded here: http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/

I used Selenium Webdriver version 3.

Download the files from the github link and open in any IDE, I used NetBeans.

The location of the Chrome driver on the computer used to review these answers will need to be changed in line 24 of selTest.java, which can be found inside  mavenproject1.

Once this has been changed, Clean and Build the packages, then run selTest.java.
